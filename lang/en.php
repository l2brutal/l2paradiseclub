	1. Acts involving the administration:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Always treat all Administrators, Game Masters and members of management with respect. Any act of disrespect, regardless of the means of communication, will result in punishment;
	</li>
	<li>
		It is forbidden to impersonate (pretend to be) any member of the administration;
	</li>
	<li>
		The administrators are free to decide any type of punishment depending on the infraction or the gravity of the same, being free to warn, to ban temporarily or even permanently;
	</li>
	<li>
		Never request levels, items, adena, teleport or any benefit to any member of the administration because you will never be answered again, if this occurs the administrator will block you permanently and you will no longer be eligible to receive any kind of support in the future;
	</li>
	<li>
		Administrators enter the game just to check on situations involving players, npcs, bosses or bugs reported in the forum;
	</li>
	<li>
		No administrator will interfere with the gameplay, economy, items or status of any player;
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	3. Acts involving players:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Comments or suggestions from any other Lineage server is prohibited in any game chat or other media linked to us. Disclosure of other servers will not be tolerated which will cause permanent and immediate banning of all accounts involved without possibility of revision;
	</li>
	<li>
		Defamation or any player who tells false stories or with the pretext of causing fear, uncertainty and doubts in players, intentionally incite, directly or indirectly, a fight, discussion, offenses to players, clans and mainly to the server is considered flame and will be punished according to the case;
	</li>
	<li>
		Creating nicknames with profanity, offense or with names intended to denigrate a player or the administration will not be allowed. Choose your nick carefully to avoid punishment &quot;for free&quot;;
	</li>
	<li>
		Disrespecting or offending other players will result in punishment. This rule applies to all communication channels, whether they are in-game or in the forum. If the offense originates from a fake account, the punishment may apply to all accounts located in our logs, so we recommend that you be careful about your conduct. In in-game chats use the / block command to not see messages from unwanted characters. Use the chat hero wisely as it involves reading the entire server. It is also forbidden to use any chat to incite or manipulate server players against administration;
	</li>
	<li>
		It will not be allowed on our low-slang savvy server as profanity. Any player who does not respect the others using this type of verbiage will be punished. This rule applies to all communication channels, whether they are in-game or in the forum;
	</li>
	<li>
		Discriminate or inferior race, religion, economic condition, sexual choice, naturalness or the simple fact of encouraging or stimulating such prejudices, besides crime, is not allowed in any condition or hypothesis on our server. The punishments will be proportional to the moral damages caused arriving, in extreme case, the absolute restriction of access to our server;
	</li>
	<li>
		Highlight defects or problems of a person, whether in-game or out of it is not correct. Pursuing in-game players causing intentional embarrassment regardless of form, and this feeling injured, may denounce the player in question who will be punished by complaint. Depending on severity or recurrence, the Racism rule may apply;
	</li>
	<li>
		The use of &quot;like&quot; accounts with members of the administration or say to be a member even if it happens through another player, with intent or not, to apply blows, is not allowed;
	</li>
	<li>
		Players who accuse, without evidence, the administration of favoritism of other players will be severely punished. The administration will not allow bad players to smear the image of the server because they are bad losers;
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	4. Use of Bots, Hacks, Mods or other programs:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		It is prohibited to use programs that interact with Lineage 2, exploits or to take advantage of any type of problem found in the game, in the forum or in the site that will benefit you in relation to other players;
	</li>
	<li>
		The use of bots, mods, hacks or any changes in the configurations of your Lineage that grant exclusive advantages (in pvp, farm, etc ...) on the others, is very serious and not tolerated in our servers. The use of this makes gameplay unfair and defendants will be banned permanently;
		<ul>
			<li>
				Reporting allegations must contain irrefutable evidence clearly showing what makes the user suspected of using illegal programs, if the evidence presented is in agreement, the administration will thoroughly investigate the defendant so that appropriate action can be taken;
			</li>
			<li>
				False accusations will be punished severely, so be absolutely sure and put together hard evidence to create a report topic in our forum. Fraud is characterized by the illicit attempt to acquire something by using a set of false information or evidence. Besides being immoral, it is considered a crime. Fraud will not be allowed on our server;
			</li>
			<li>
				Falsifying evidence, in addition to anti-gambling and immoral, only brings losses to the responsible. All complaints are thoroughly analyzed and checked against our logs. If any false print or video is identified with the intention of generating false evidence, the defendant&#39;s ban will be immediately reversed;
			</li>
			<li>
				In case of accounts being used by third parties for the use of bots, the account will not be unlocked and everything that is in it will be permanently lost;
			</li>
			<li>
				The use of keyboard macros, mouse or programs that make the gameplay automated is also considered a bot type, players caught using something like that will be punished depending on what is done within the game. If the administration deems it to be serious, the player may be permanently banned;
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		A bug is usually a technical problem on the server. The use of BUGs may offer advantage to a particular player and any circumstance that may give advantage to only a few players is not allowed. Therefore, it is an act considered as cheating and will result in banishment;
	</li>
	<li>
		If a player discovers a bug (problem / failure) in the game, forum or website must report immediately to the administration;
	</li>
	<li>
		Any clan that disrespects any of the rules mentioned here, can and will be deleted and offending members punished. Since the clan will only be deleted if most of the members of the clan participate in the infraction;
	</li>
	<li>
		Any player who creates a fake account to practice an attitude outside the rules described herein will be punished, both in his original account used to play and in his fake account used to harm other players and / or the server;
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	5. Anti-gambling actions:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		It is considered anti-gambling any attitude that destabilizes the harmony of the server or the conviviality and relationship between the players. The most common anti-gambling practices are, for example, PK forcing with the exclusive purpose of killing a player and getting hold of their items, selling one item and delivering another, etc. These practices are not tolerated in our servers and, if duly proven, cause the punishment of its responsible;
	</li>
	<li>
		It is characterized as blackmail or bribing the fact that a player offers to another something that is of their interest with the intention that it omits or disguises some information originated from something suspicious / undue. For example: A player has discovered a bug and offers other items / money so that it does not report to management. In this case, if the involvement is confirmed, both will be banned;
	</li>
	<li>
		The Olympics feed will not be considered anti-gambling because it is an occasional thing in the system when some friend happens to fight the other and by an agreement between them one of them loses purposefully. We put some filters to avoid as much as possible this happens so often, but it&#39;s not 100% guaranteed;
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	6. Accounts / Items
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		It is totally forbidden any kind of trading accounts on our server. Any account that is sold or announced will affect that rule. It is also important to note that an account acquired through the aforementioned means will not give ownership to the buyer. This means that the original owner of the account may make a request to the administration and consequently recover the account in question in the future. Therefore trade in accounts, in addition to being unauthorized by the administration, has no guarantees whatsoever;
	</li>
	<li>
		Your account is personal and non-transferable, which means that you are responsible for your own security in the game. Never give your password to anyone else, including admin. Make sure that the computer you use to play is safe. Never run extra interactivity programs with your Lineage 2, which was not provided by the administration, as they may contain viruses and keylogs that will result in theft of your user accounts and / or items;
	</li>
	<li>
		The administration is not responsible for any theft, items dropped or destroyed. The administration ensures the complete integrity and security of the server and therefore, hacks are not possible to steal items or accounts directly on the server, website or forum, in other words, any type of theft is caused by carelessness or misuse of users;
	</li>
	<li>
		All user data (their veracity and maintenance) are the sole responsibility of the user. Take care of your data and keep your email account active as it is necessary to recover your password if you forget it. Management shall not be liable for any data that has been forgotten, lost, deleted or canceled for any reason;
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	NOTE: These rules can be changed without prior notice!
